# UOCIS322 - Project 5 #
Brevet time calculator with MongoDB!

## Overview

This project implements a `Submit` and `Display` button onto a brevet time calculator. The `Submit` stores the entered data onto a database (through MongoDB), then wipes the entries on the webpage. The `Display` button fetches the most recent entry into the database, and displays it on the webpage after refreshing the page. This project utilizes the Flask framework, MongoDB, and JQuery. 

Information on the algorithm used in the acp_times.py file can be found here: https://rusa.org/pages/acp-brevet-control-times-calculator
